# Objectives 

##### *Maintains a detailed record of the customers such as a number of customers,amount,total orders.
##### *Reduce human errors and automatic calculations are done without errors.
##### *Can generate an invoice and detailed report on customer payments.
##### *The automatically generated reports are flexible for the clients to pay to the employees.

# Existing System:

In the existing system, we have employees working for different clients on different projects. The manager calculates all the details of customer. 
But if he makes any mistake in data entry of calculating the hours then a wrong report about payment is sent to the client and it may over cost the client. The client again has to recheck everything and sent it back to the consultancy for re-evaluation or sometimes the employee does not get the correct pay. This helps to generate an invoice which is done manually.

The client has identified these problems:

##### *Generation of the Invoice is very slow and takes a long time to remit to the employee.
##### *The generation reports took even longer then invoice.
##### *Delay in all the reports due to manual work and there are possible human errors which may cost the client.
##### *Manual work is expensive
##### *Data loss can happen easily
