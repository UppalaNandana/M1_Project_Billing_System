A Restaurant which focuses on how best they can use technology in achieving their business goals. clients. They work according to the requirements of the user information. The manager collects the data of the customers like the Name and the Food details and the respective user information is noted down and calculated manually. The detailed invoice is done manually. The manager might have made mistakes in entering the data or calculating the amount. This would result in a false report and could create problems.

So for that reason there is a set up called Billing System which can take the customers details and provides the invoice and which also can be stored in the database.
Which saves a lot of time and human effort.
